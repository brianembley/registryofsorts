Name:1930 Black & White Imagery, NJ 
Description:  This is a historical image data set of a mosaic of black and white photography from the early 1930s. The source imagery was hand cut to produce 261 mosaic tile prints on linen-backed paper. The data set was produced by scanning these mosaic tile prints at 400 dpi and saved as TIFF images. The scanned TIFF images had an approximate pixel resolution of 6.5 feet. They were georeferenced against 1995/97 color infrared digital orthophotography. The georeferenced TIFFs were clipped and merged into a single raster image for reference purposes only. The digital product has not been corrected for distortion or vertical displacement. They do not meet the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA). It is referenced to Geographic WGS 1984.
