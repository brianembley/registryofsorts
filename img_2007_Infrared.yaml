Name: 2007 False Color Near-Infrared Imagery, NJ
Description:  This service displays the 3 natural color bands from the 4-band project.  It is in the State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 Coordinates, U.S. Survey Feet. 
Aerial photography of the entire State of New Jersey was captured during March-May, 2007. Two flight dates (2007-04-30 and 2007-05-03) were rejected from the original 2007 flight due to excessive leaf conditions. Spring 2008 re-flights were acquired in three missions dating: 2008-04-03, 2008-04-10, and 2008-04-15. The final orthophotos for parts of Warren, Hunterdon, Sussex, Passaic, Essex, Union, and all of Bergen and Hudson Counties were created utilizing both years of imagery.
Multi-spectral digital orthophotography was produced at a scale of 1:2400 (1" = 200') with a 1 foot pixel resolution.
